This script takes multiple VCF files as input, extracts SNV and INDELS variants from the files, merges variants, and generates a unified mutation table as output.
The output can be used as an input for analysis such a non-synonymous/synonymous mutation cancer driver analysis, e.g., dndscv (Martincorena et al., 2017).
